0) WHAT IS THIS ?
-----------------

This directory contains the source code for a simulator of the
RC3600/RC7000 computer from "Regnecentralen A/S".  The basic computer
is a Data General Nova CPU but much of the I/O is unique to the RC
version.

1) PORTABILITY
--------------

This is written on FreeBSD 6.X in pretty generic C code.  I have
undoubtedly used some FreeBSD specific features for convenience,
but patches will be gladly accepted.

2) ARCHITECTURAL NOTES
----------------------

The over all structure is a central core implementing the instruction
set and the configuration mechanism and add on I/O drivers.

A secondary channel is necessary to configure I/O devices in the
simulation, for instance which files to load disk images from etc.

The current version offers only a command-line interface, and access
to the secondary channel is by typing CTRL-A (see below).

The emulator offers a number of hooks for extension in addition to
plugging I/O units in.  The most notable is the "trace" mechanism
which allows a function to be called when the instruction in a
particular core location is executed, or when a particular instruction
is executed.

The trace facility is currently used to implement "idle sleep" and
message logging for the DOMUS operating system (see os_domus.c).

3) USAGE
--------

Typically the emulator is started with a Diablo disk image:

	rc3600 -c "dkp 0 load domus3.03.dkp"

The terminal will behave like the console TTY on the RC3600.

The -c argument is a command for the secondary channel, if during
operation it is desirable to load another Diablo disk, this can
be done by typing:

	CTRL-A dkp 1 load domus2.01.dkp

The emulator can be killed by typing CTRL-C.

If given the -v argument, the emulator will print extensive
per instruction tracing to stdout.  Good for debugging, bad
for speed and disk-space.


4) SECONDARY CHANNEL
--------------------

dkp <unit> load <filename>

	Load contents of Diablo disk.

dkp <unit> save <filename>

	Save contents of Diablo disk.   This must always be done
	explictly.

cpu switch <value>

	Set the frontpanel switches.  Value is specivied in C
	notation:
		cpu switch 32827     (decimal)
		cpu switch 0x803b    (hex))
		cpu switch 0100073   (octal))

cpu autoload

	Boot the system from the device indicated by the front panel
	switches.
	
domus sleep

	Recognize location 50 as idle system and avoid soaking up
	CPU on the host system emulating no activity.

domus msg <filename>

	Trace SENDMESSAGE and SENDANSWER and log messages passed
	in the file given.


5) I/O EMULATION
----------------

TTY

	Takes input from stdin, tries to put the terminal in raw mode
	if possible.  Output to stderr.

PTP
	Punches to file "_.ptp"
	(XXX: should be configured via secondary channel).

PTR
	Reads from file "_.ptr"
	(XXX: should be configured via secondary channel).

LPT
	Prints to file "/tmp/_.lpt"
	(XXX: should be configured via secondary channel).

FLOPPY
	Not currently working.

MAGIC
	A cheat device for transferring files to or from the local
	filesystem.

	Not currently working.

DKP
	Four drives.  Contents loaded and saved via secondary channel.

RTC
	Implements four rates as per documentation.

6) HINTS
--------

The easiest way to transfer files to and from the DOMUS system
is using the PTP and PTR devices.  Use $PTRN and $PTPN inside
DOMUS.

It is possible to script the emulator, but the commands have
to be paced in order to not get lost:

	#!/bin/sh

	set -e 
	(
	echo 
	echo PTP
	sleep 1
	echo PTR
	sleep 1
	echo DELET PH00B
	sleep 1
	echo 'DOMAC BIN.PH00B LIST.$PTPN $PTRN'
	sleep 10
	) | ./rc3600 -c "dkp 0 load domus3.03.dkp"
